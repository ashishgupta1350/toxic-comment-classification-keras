 joined Coding blocks to learn C++ as a part of their Launchpad program. Before I begin, let me just tell you how petrified I was of the term programming. Around three months of pure learning, hundreds of questions later some of which in retrospect were very embarrassing but hey, in my defence I was absolutely new to the world of coding.

Impressed with Coding Blocks, I made my brother join their Java program. He was taught by Sumeet Malik who in my brother's admission is probably the most patient teacher ever with a very warm smile, who is ready to schedule an extra class at the drop of a hat much to my brother's dismay.

Arnav Gupta is an alumnus of our college (Delhi College of Engineering or DTU as it is now called) who is now an instructor at Coding Blocks is simply genius.

I'll just lay out the facts for you and you guys be the judge!

1. He is one of the best Android developers in the country. Speaks often at Android Conventions.

2. He has been worked with big companies like Cyanogen.

3.Sold his startup in college, Greplr to Micromax.

4. The number of competitions, hackathons and all such events that he has WON can fill up many pages.

5.He is a national level swimmer too.

Feeling incompetent, right?

Well, he can do that to people without even realising and it made all of us work even harder, serving as a constant source of motivation and inspiration.

FYI: Coding Blocks is owned by the same person behind the epic VidyaMandir Classes or VMC -- Manmohan Gupta who also in his spare time runs a multimillion dollar IT company called Naggaro which is headquartered in Munich, Germany.

They offer everything right from the beginner level courses to courses on topics like Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence and have programs to prepare you for IT interviews

So anyone even remotely interested to enter the realm of Programming should go there right now.


I joined the LaunchPad course at Coding Blocks, Pitampura in August. I was taught by Prateek Sir. The experience has been enriching. Each of the classes were informative and helped me build my confidence in C++ and data structures, that I used to fear during my college. I am satisfied and am glad to have joined Coding Blocks. Prateek Sir is very patient when it comes to explaining logics and concepts. I am myself from Electronics and communication engineering background. Trust me, irrespective of your background, the pace and content of the course are such that you will be able to follow up.
